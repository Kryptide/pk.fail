# PK.Fail Checker
This is a batch file that will check if your firmware has the UEFI/Bios vulnerability using Binarly's PK.Fail checker.
The script will find your firmware  file automatically and upload it to Binarlys online checker.
The output will give a status of "status": "vulnerable" or  "status":  "not-vulnerable"

Windows may require you to select "More Info" and "Run Anyway". 
There is nothing harmful in this script. Please feel free to look into pk.fail_checker.bat in files for yourself.
